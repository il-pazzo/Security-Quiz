      "explanation": "D is correct. Documentary evidence directly supports or proves a definitive assertion.\n\nA, B, and C are incorrect. Exculpatory evidence proves innocence. Inculpatory evidence proves guilt. Demonstrative evidence, which can be in the form of charts, graphs, drawings, and so forth, is used to help nontechnical people, such as the members of a jury, understand an event.",

      "correct_answers": "C", 
      "explanation": "C is correct. In a full-scale test, all personnel are usually involved and may actually conduct activities as they would during a real incident. This type of test is more complex and normally requires extensive resources, such as people and equipment, so it is typically conducted infrequently.\n\nA, B, and D are incorrect. A tabletop exercise is a type of group review. The documentation review is the simplest form of test, in which the business continuity plan, disaster recovery plan, and associated documents are reviewed by relevant personnel including managers, recovery team members, and anyone else who may have responsibilities directly affecting plans. In a walkthrough test, team members go through the motions of fulfilling the responsibilities and conducting the activities required during an actual incident or disaster.",

      "explanation": "D is correct. WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access version 2) currently provides the strongest available encryption for wireless networks.\n\nA and C are incorrect because WPA and WEP are weaker protocols. B is incorrect because HTTPS is a secure protocol for connecting on the Web, but not within your own network.",

      "explanation": "A is correct. Mean time between failures (MTBF) represents the manufacturer\u2019s best guess (based on historical data) regarding how much time will pass between major failures of that component. This is assuming that more than one failure will occur, which means that the component will be repaired, rather than replaced.\n\nB, C, and D are incorrect. Mean time to recovery (MTTR) is the amount of time it takes for a hardware component to recover from a failure. The mean time to failure (MTTF) is the length of time a device is expected to last in operation. In MTTF, only a single, definitive failure will occur and will require that the device be replaced rather than repaired. Mean time to replace is not a valid term.",

A preventative control keeps someone from performing a malicious act, provided that she doesn\u2019t know the control is there and is not aware of the consequences for violating it.\n\nB, C, and D are incorrect. A corrective control is used to correct a condition when there is either no control at all or the existing control is ineffective. Normally, a corrective control is temporary until a more permanent solution is put into place. The difference between a deterrent control and a preventive control is that a deterrent control requires the person to have knowledge of the control in order for it to work. Users do not have to have knowledge of a preventative control for it to function. A compensating control assists and mitigates the risk an existing control is unable to mitigate.",

Be sure that you have enough gas! For very critical systems, multiple generators (tested regularly) are a common control.\n\nA is incorrect because a power conditioner helps provide clean power that is less likely to harm systems; it has nothing to do with power outages. B and D are incorrect because they provide backup power for only a short period of time and are often used to allow a graceful shutdown of less critical systems.",

VLANS do not physically segment hosts; they logically segment them, and they allow different segments to receive different security policies.\n\nA, B, and C are incorrect. VLANS do not physically segment hosts; they logically segment them. VLANs help eliminate broadcast domains, not create them. VLANS allow different segments to receive different security policies.",

An anomaly-based system detects unusual network traffic patterns based upon a baseline of normal network traffic. Signature-based systems use predefined traffic signatures, typically downloaded from a vendor. Filter-based systems, such as routers and firewalls, base detection on access control lists that specify traffic that is permitted and denied.",

      "explanation": "D is correct. Syslog is a logging facility found in UNIX and Linux systems, which can be used on either a centralized or decentralized basis. \n\nA, B, and C are incorrect. Centralized log management involves collecting logs from across the network into on system and being able to review them as a group. Security Information Event Management (SIEM) is a centralized method of obtaining logs and other data from disparate devices across the network. Decentralized log management means that logs are managed and reviewed on a host-by-host basis, rather than as a centralized, consolidated group.",

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses a Management Information Base, or MIB, specific to each device to obtain device information from. Syslog is a log server found in UNIX and Linux systems.",

It is used to generate a public and private key pair.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is a key exchange protocol used in public key cryptography. It is used to negotiate, agree upon, and establish a secure session between two parties. AES is the Advanced Encryption Standard, which is not used in public key cryptography; it is a symmetric key cryptography algorithm. SHA-2 is the second iteration of the Secure Hashing Algorithm and is used to generate message digests for plaintext. It is not used in public key cryptography to exchange keys or establish secure sessions.",

Key streaming involves sending individual characters of the key through an algorithm and using a mathematical XOR function to change the output.\n\nB, C, and D are incorrect. Key repetition is not a valid answer or term. Key exchange involves generating and exchanging an asymmetric key used for a particular communications session, or exchanging public keys in order to use them for public key cryptography. Key stretching is a technique used to change a weak key to a stronger key by feeding it into an algorithm to produce an enhanced key.",

It uses the RC4 streaming protocol and weak initialization vectors (24-bit) to encrypt data on wireless networks.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect. WPA2 is an advanced encryption protocol that uses AES. WPA was an interim protocol used to correct some of WEP\u2019s weaknesses. It uses the TKIP protocol. 802.1X is a port-based authentication method, not a wireless encryption protocol.",

      "explanation": "B is correct. A proxy is typically not used as a traffic-filtering device based upon port or protocol, but it makes requests on behalf of internal clients.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect. A firewall is a more complex device, most often seen placed behind the border router. A switch does not filter traffic based upon port or protocol, since it works at a lower level in the OSI model. A router should be used as a first-level filtering device, because it has the ability to filter on basic characteristics of traffic such as port and protocol.",

Content filters can scan content as it leaves the network, checking for certain types of content that has been pre-specified within the software.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect because those technologies will not content-filter messages. Antispam filters are used to catch and quarantine spam messages. Caching proxy servers are used to cache, or store, messages for speedy retrieval in the future.

Using network address translation (NAT) in conjunction with a firewall enables you to share one external address with multiple internal hosts that require external addresses for their connectivity.\n\nB, C, and D are incorrect. A DMZ can contain servers behind a firewall, allowing public access, but it does not inherently offer NAT services.

It uses a web of trust model, which means that each individual has to be able to trust every other individual who uses PGP to encrypt and decrypt data sent and received by them.\n\nA, C, and D are incorrect. RSA is the de-facto key generation protocol used in public key cryptography, and it is normally used in a public key infrastructure type of environment. Diffie-Hellman Exchange (DHE) is a key negotiation and agreement protocol that is used to exchange keys and establish a secure communications session.

C is incorrect because service level agreements are made between a company and a third party, such as a contractor or a supplier. D is incorrect because access control policies help protect against unauthorized access, both physical and logical, but they don\u2019t discuss how users can and cannot use systems.",
