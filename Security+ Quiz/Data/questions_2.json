The documentation review is the simplest form of test, in which the business continuity plan, disaster recovery plan, and associated documents are reviewed by relevant personnel including managers, recovery team members, and anyone else who may have responsibilities directly affecting plans. In a walkthrough test, team members go through the motions of fulfilling the responsibilities and conducting the activities required during an actual incident or disaster.",
